# MiniURL

**MiniURL** is a URL shortener application that converts long URLs into concise, 8-character codes. It provides users with a simple interface to generate shortened URLs, view their redirection links, and track the number of clicks. The frontend is built using **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** for rendering the data.

## Features

- **URL Shortening**: Convert long URLs into unique 8-character short codes.
- **Analytics**: Track the number of clicks for each shortened URL.
- **Display Data**: The frontend shows the generated short code, the original URL, and the total number of clicks.
- **Redirection**: The shortened URL automatically redirects users to the original link.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Frontend**: EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
- **Other**: Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)

## How It Works

1. User submits a long URL.
2. The backend generates an 8-character short code.
3. The frontend displays:
   - The short code generated.
   - The original (redirect) URL.
   - The number of clicks on the shortened link.
4. Clicking the short URL redirects the user to the original URL.
5. Analytics track and display the total number of clicks on each link.
